=====

A Java implementation of the Simple Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
v2.0 specification at http://www.simplecloud.info/ and slated to be released
as an IETF specification.

This project was originally forked from the eSCIMo project under development
by the Apache Directory team and may be merged back into that project in the
future.  See http://directory.apache.org/escimo/ for more details.  The
system currently provides POST, GET and PUT functionality for the SCIM
User resource and allows extensions to be created and registered.
