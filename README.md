Igloo - Deprecated
==================

This project was originally a Java implementation of the Simple Cross-domain
Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 specification at http://www.simplecloud.info/
during the period when the IETF specification was being created.  As such,
this implementation is not compliant

A new project that encompassed what we'd learned was started once the
specification was complete which is under active development and will
become part of the [Apache Directory](http://directory.apache.org) project.
Please consider using [SCIMple Identity] for Java-based SCIM servers and
clients.

This project is currently being used internally but will be deleted when
that application is deprecated - at that point this repository will be
deleted.
